Hello. 
After having my Database Modelling and design & MsSQL lessons, I decided to practice my skills with one real life project. 
I made a home expenditure database model and after every shopping i made inputs. Though i experience some problems on the way, with  the help of my instructors, Martin, Frank and Leon i was able to overcome those difficulties. 
Please check my model and scripts to make it better. 
Best regards
Gurkan
